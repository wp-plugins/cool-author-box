== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The author name is displayed as the login name of the author.

To set how an author's name is displayed go to the author admin page and use the "Display name publicly as" option.

= There is no bio displayed / where do I post my bio?

The bio field is generated from the Biographical Info entered in the author admin page.

= Where do I upload a photo for my bio?

The bio image is your Gravatar and is linked to your email address. If you don't have a Gravatar yet you can get one by visiting www.gravatar.com. If you have a Gravatar but it is not displaying it means you need to change your email address in the user admin section to match the one your Gravatar is registered with.
